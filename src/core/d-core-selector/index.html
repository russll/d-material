@group Polymer Core Elements

`<core-selector>` is used to manage a list of elements that can be selected.

The attribute `selected` indicates which item element is being selected.
The attribute `multi` indicates if multiple items can be selected at once.
Tapping on the item element would fire `core-activate` event. Use
`core-select` event to listen for selection changes.

Example:

    <core-selector selected="0">
      <div>Item 1</div>
      <div>Item 2</div>
      <div>Item 3</div>
    </core-selector>

`<core-selector>` is not styled. Use the `core-selected` CSS class to style the selected element.

    <style>
      .item.core-selected {
        background: #eee;
      }
    </style>
    ...
    <core-selector>
      <div class="item">Item 1</div>
      <div class="item">Item 2</div>
      <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    </core-selector>
